# Slider

This slider was made using Jquery library. The slider changes pictures automatically. A user can change the pictures with the help of buttons and pictures preview panel too. Moreover the slider changes sepia of each picture from 0% to 100% for more beautiful visual effect. Now this application works correctly only in the Google Chrome, but soon it will be work in each popular browser.
